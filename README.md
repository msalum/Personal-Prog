Personal Assignment in Java

**Theme: Horoscope of the day** 

Target is to use knowledges from previous lessons and use them all in this project.

**How does it work?**
* User inserts his/hers birthday date
* Program calculates his/hers horoscope sign
* Program asks if user would like to know his/hers daily horoscope?
* If yes - then prints out horoscope of the day
* If no - thanks the users for using program
* Note: Program uses for every horoscope the same text, but changes the name of the sign according to entered date.
  Example: if **Capricorn**, prints out: The tip of the day for **Capricorn** is ...
  If some other sign: The tip of the day for **Lion** is .... etc.

**Text:**

Tensions with money, ownership, or workload and shared responsibilities are 
mounting now,**(SIGN)**. While this may take another day or two to play out, 
**(SIGN)** likely to confront some of these matters today, even if this happens 
indirectly. An awkward angle between Mars and Chiron points to the need to 
make adjustments rather than bold moves. Others may not be clear with **(SIGN)** 
today, but consider that they may not be in touch with what it is they truly 
desire. **(SIGN)** ,try not to worry about mixed signals and instead wait until others 
have sorted things out. Asserting yourself may have awkward results since 
this is not the best day to understand your own desires, either. This also 
applies to material desires, so you might want to put off making larger purchases
just for now. **(SIGN)**, do not worry, tomorrow will be a better day! :)(smiley)

**Next level challenge:**
* Add GUI
GUI is added using JavaFX. Program uses 2 windows to display text. 
* Windows
In main window user inserts his/her birthday. If date is entered as requested, than program calculates zodiac sign and displays it in new window. In small new windows correct sign is displayed and program asks if user will like to see horoscope of the day, if answered yes, program will return to main window, if answered no, then program will exit with nice wish. In main window the daily text is displayed with correct sign.
